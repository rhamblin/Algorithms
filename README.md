# Algorithms
This is a personal bank of algorithms that I am aiming to keep adding
to as I practice implementing them both in Python and Java as I make time.
These are meant to be fundamental sorting and searching algorithms. I don't own or make claims of creating these algorithms. This was
used as a personal exercise in order to increase my knowledge of the languages being used to implement the algorithm and deepen my understanding of the algorithms being exhibited.
For educational purposes only.

Note: Full documentation of an algorithm will most likely be in the Java implementation as I am still learning all the proper techniques used in the Python community however dont be surprised if they're some documented Python implementations !
